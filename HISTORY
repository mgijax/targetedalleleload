CHANGES: 
1) added mutationSubType SangerAlleleInput and SangerInterpreter

c) added NOTE_TEMPLATE_NONCONDITIONAL_AI_PROMOTERDRIVEN
d) added CASSETTE_L1L2_6XOSPNENH_BACT_P='This is a new promoter 1'
Note: totally unclear why the following are needed - the value is not used. Path of least
resistance to add them

f) added CASSETTE_IFITM2_INTRON_L1L2_GT1_LF2A_LACZ_BETACTP_NEO='This is a new promoter 3'
g) added CASSETTE_IFITM2_INTRON_L1L2_GT2_LF2A_LACZ_BETACTP_NEO='This is a new promoter 4'
h) added CASSETTE_IFITM2_INTRON_L1L2_GTK_LACZ_BETACTP_NEO='This is a new promoter 5'
i) added CASSETTE_L1L2_GT1_LF2A_LACZ_BETACTP_NEO='This is a new promoter 6'

CHANGES: TR11202
1) LookupAllelesByProjectId.java - added AND acc._MGIType_key = 11
2) LookupAllelesByMarker.java - AND a._Allele_Status_key != 847112
3) SangerInterpreter.java - updated Sanger allele types (they call them
   mutation types) which have changed in the input file 
   e.g. "targeted_non_conditional" is now "Targeted Non Conditional"
4) TargetedAlleleLoad.java - added comments
5) config defaults - added new cassette for eucomm and csd

1) Add norcomm specific classes and cfg files (not used yet)
2) Add orphaned MCL when the last real MCL moves away from an allele
3) Create derivation records on the fly as needed as long as all the
   required information already exists in the database

5) Update note templates to be more generic to avoid needing to calculate
   which is the start and which is the end
6) Format the exception messages better

CHANGES:
1) tal_*.config.default - added config parameters required for overriding notes
2) added a quality control statistics tracking object and improved reporting of
   aggregate errors to the diagnositc, curator, and load email report
3) incorporated the QC tracking to the reports by refactoring inheritance so
   all the processors and interpretors have access to the QC object
4) adjusted regeneron interpreter so it now reports on records without 
   coordinates but allows them to be loaded.  New note template added 
   for these
5) differentiates if an allele-marker association changed versus an 
   allele type changed (used to be bunched together)
6) associate CSD alleles to the parental STRAIN key not the 
   parental ES CELL key
7) refactor the alleleLookupByMarker and AlleleLookupByProjectId lookups 
   to use a static cache instead of having them reinstantiated and 
   maintained in multiple places

CHANGES:
    - Since we switched to iterating be cell line (instead of allele), 
      updating the note was adding a new note for each cell line. 
      This update makes it so only add one note per allele gets added.
    - Prime the allele lookup by project id with the project logical DB
      not the es cell logical db
