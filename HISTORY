CHANGES:
    - Since we switched to iterating be cell line (instead of allele), 
      updating the note was adding a new note for each cell line. 
      This update makes it so only add one note per allele gets added.
    - Prime the allele lookup by project id with the project logical DB
      not the es cell logical db
