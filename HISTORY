CHANGES:
1) Add configuration variable and code to switch the load
   to only process updated derivations

STAFF: jmason
CHANGES:
1) Add configuration variable and code to switch the load
   to only process updates OR only create new records
   the toggle is the boolean TAL_UPDATE (true = update only)
2) Refactor logging of changes to clean up processing method

STAFF: jmason
CHANGES:
1) Add norcomm specific classes and cfg files (not used yet)
2) Add orphaned MCL when the last real MCL moves away from an allele
3) Create derivation records on the fly as needed as long as all the
   required information already exists in the database
4) Update derivation associations when an MCL changes to a new allele
5) Update note templates to be more generic to avoid needing to calculate
   which is the start and which is the end
6) Format the exception messages better

   and interpreter
2) Update sequence generation  to count all alleles per labcode when
   calculating the next default allele sequence number
3) New jnumbers for each provider
4) Load is run by provider now, not pipeline
5)

CHANGES:
1) checked in KnockoutAlleleInterpreter


TAG: targetedalleleload-4-3-0-12
DATE: 12/08/2009

CHANGES:
1) tal_regeneron.config.default - changed missing note template
2) Always use smallest coordinate as the start of the deletion

DATE: 12/07/2009
STAFF: jmason
CHANGES:
1) tal_*.config.default - added config parameters required for overriding notes
2) added a quality control statistics tracking object and improved reporting of
   aggregate errors to the diagnositc, curator, and load email report
3) incorporated the QC tracking to the reports by refactoring inheritance so
   all the processors and interpretors have access to the QC object
4) adjusted regeneron interpreter so it now reports on records without 
   coordinates but allows them to be loaded.  New note template added 
   for these
5) differentiates if an allele-marker association changed versus an 
   allele type changed (used to be bunched together)
6) associate CSD alleles to the parental STRAIN key not the 
   parental ES CELL key
7) refactor the alleleLookupByMarker and AlleleLookupByProjectId lookups 
   to use a static cache instead of having them reinstantiated and 
   maintained in multiple places

CHANGES:
    - Since we switched to iterating be cell line (instead of allele), 
      updating the note was adding a new note for each cell line. 
      This update makes it so only add one note per allele gets added.
    - Prime the allele lookup by project id with the project logical DB
      not the es cell logical db
